# Bankist-App

A simple banking application developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript which helps you to track of your incomes and expenses, analyze your movements and forecast your
savings. It will handle the fund transfer between the accounts. I have implemented login credentials validations, fund transfer validations, loan request validations
and logout timer as well. You can also close your account and can sort the transactions. This project is not responsive.
